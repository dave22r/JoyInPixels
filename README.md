# JoyInPixels
Joy in Pixels is a minimalist web app for capturing and revisiting joyful moments. Users can drop memories into a pixelated jar, spin an emotion wheel to prompt reflection, and replay past moments for a quick lift. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to encourage mindfulness through playful interaction.
